 # Conversion Interactive Candidate Test

## Instructions

Please build a landing page for a potential job seeker. All the assets you need are inside the IMG folder. Feel free to use filler text or lorem ipsum for content on the mockup file as we are not focusing on that part of this assessment. Clone or download this repository for the candidate assessment. If you make a pull request instead, please create a branch with your name and show your work there. The layout does not have to be pixel perfect but get as close as you can.

### Rules

- If you use a library (css/javascript), please explain why you chose it.
- Don't worry about validating the form but please create the form with the proper action.
- Make the landing page responsive.
- Create a menu with the following options: Company, Drivers, and About. Build the menu as you see fit. Show your creativity!
- Use FontAwesome 5 for your icons (e.g. arrow icons, search icons etc) Use this link below to pull it into
  this project
  ` <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.15.2/css/all.min.css" integrity="sha512-HK5fgLBL+xu6dm/Ii3z4xhlSUyZgTT9tuc/hSrtw6uzJOvgRr2a9jyxxT1ely+B+xFAmJKVSTbpM/CuL7qxO8w==" crossorigin="anonymous" />`  
   to pull in font awesome.
- you can find the DOCS here `https://fontawesome.com/`
- Links on the page do not have to be live.

### Bonus Points

- Create an animation or an effect on the "apply now" button and on the arrow toward the bottom of the page.
- Create a cookie that value is equal to the url and expires in a month.
- You can use the colors red, black and white but it youâ€™ll get more attention if you can actually pull the hex values.
